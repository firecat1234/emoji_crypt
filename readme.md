Emoji Encoder/Decoder
A Rust command-line tool for hiding and retrieving secret messages by encoding them into emoji sequences using Unicode variation selectors.

Overview
This project demonstrates a simple steganography technique where secret messages are hidden in plain sight by encoding them within emoji strings. Each message is encoded using a base emoji combined with variation selectors to represent bits of the message. An improved encoding scheme is used here to pack 4 bits (a nibble) per emoji pair by utilizing Unicode variation selectors U+FE00 through U+FE0F.

For example, the message "Hello" is encoded into a sequence of emoji pairs. When decoded, the program retrieves the original message.

Encoding Scheme
Encoding:
For each byte of the input message, split the byte into two 4-bit nibbles. Each nibble is then encoded as:

A base emoji (default is ðŸ˜€, but this can be changed)
A variation selector from U+FE00 (representing 0) to U+FE0F (representing 15)
This means each byte becomes 2 emoji pairs (4 Unicode characters), making the overall encoding more efficient than one bit per emoji pair.

Decoding:
The program extracts the variation selectors from the emoji string, reassembles the nibbles into bytes, and converts them back to the original text.

Prerequisites
Rust â€“ Install via rustup.
Installation
Clone the Repository (or create a new project):

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emoji_encoder.git
cd emoji_encoder
Or create a new Cargo project:

bash
Copy
cargo new emoji_encoder
cd emoji_encoder
Replace the Contents of src/main.rs:

Copy and paste the provided Rust code (the improved version) into src/main.rs.

Usage
Build the Project
Compile the project using Cargo:

bash
Copy
cargo build --release
Running the Program
The program supports two commands: encode and decode.

Encode a Message
To encode a message, use:

bash
Copy
cargo run -- encode "Your secret message" "ðŸ˜€"
Example:

bash
Copy
cargo run -- encode "Hello" "ðŸ˜€"
This will output an encoded string consisting of emoji and variation selectors.

Decode a Message
To decode an encoded string, use:

bash
Copy
cargo run -- decode "<your_encoded_string_here>"
Example:

Suppose you have the following encoded string:

Copy
ðŸ˜€ï¸ƒðŸ˜€ï¸ŠðŸ˜€ï¸‚ðŸ˜€ï¸ˆ
Run:

bash
Copy
cargo run -- decode "ðŸ˜€ï¸ƒðŸ˜€ï¸ŠðŸ˜€ï¸‚ðŸ˜€ï¸ˆ"
This should print the original secret message (e.g., :().

Example
Encoding "Hello":

bash
Copy
cargo run -- encode "Hello"
Output might be (using the improved nibble method):

Copy
ðŸ˜€ï¸„ðŸ˜€ï¸ˆðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸…ðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸ŒðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸ŒðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸Ž
Decoding the above output:

bash
Copy
cargo run -- decode "ðŸ˜€ï¸„ðŸ˜€ï¸ˆðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸…ðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸ŒðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸ŒðŸ˜€ï¸†ðŸ˜€ï¸Ž"
The program should output:

nginx
Copy
Hello
Improvements
Efficiency:
The improved scheme encodes 4 bits per emoji pair by using the full range of variation selectors (U+FE00 to U+FE0F). This reduces the character overhead compared to encoding one bit per pair.

Customization:
You can easily change the base emoji by providing a different emoji as the third command-line argument when encoding.

Error Handling:
The program checks for incomplete sequences or invalid variation selectors during decoding and reports errors accordingly.
